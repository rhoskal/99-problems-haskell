{- Problem 1
 Write a function that returns the last element of a list.
-}
myLast :: [a] -> Maybe a
myLast [] = Nothing
myLast [x] = Just x
myLast (_ : xs) = myLast $ tail xs

{- Problem 2
 Find the last two (last and penultimate) elements of a list.
-}
lastTwo :: [a] -> Maybe [a]
lastTwo [] = Nothing
lastTwo [_] = Nothing
lastTwo [x, y] = Just [x, y]
lastTwo (_ : xs) = lastTwo xs

{- Problem 3
 Find the nth element of a list. The first element in the list is number 1.
-}

elementAt _ [] = Nothing
elementAt n (x : xs)
  | n == 1 = Just x
